# Python Fundamentals Practice Repository
Hello, everyone! I'm Jade, and this is my first repo on GitHub. 

This repository contains my Python practice code while learning the fundamentals.

## What's Inside
* Organized code snippets and small exercises grouped by **core Python concepts** (e.g., variables, control flow, loop, functions, file I/O, basic OOP, testing)

* Files may lack extensive comments or perfect naming conventions as they were primarily for my own understanding during the learning process.

* Files are structured into folders based on the main topic they cover.

## Purpose

*   **Personal Learning Log:** This repo acts as a record of my journey learning Python basics.
*   **Reference:** I can revisit these examples to recall specific syntax or concepts.
*   **Demonstrating Foundations:** Shows my commitment to understanding the building blocks before moving to more complex projects.

## Note on Code Quality

As these are learning exercises focused on grasping concepts:
*   Code may lack extensive comments.
*   Variable/function naming might not always be perfectly descriptive.
*   Original problem statements from tutorials may not be included.

## Getting Started

Feel free to browse the folders organized by topic. While the code is functional for its learning purpose, it's primarily intended as a reference point for foundational concepts.

**Thank you for visiting! Feedback is welcome.**
